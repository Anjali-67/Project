      Phonograph or Gramophone- A record player.<br />
      <br />
      Established in 2023, with the intention of introducing the past to this
      new generation.<br />
      <br />
      Thomas Edison, conceived the principle of recording and reproducing sound
      between May and July 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to "play back"
      recorded telegraph messages and to automate speech sounds for transmission
      by telephone. His first experiments were with waxed paper. He announced
      his invention of the first phonograph, a device for recording and
      replaying sound.<br />
      <br />
      Edison's early phonographs recorded onto a thin sheet of metal, normally
      tinfoil, which was temporarily wrapped around a helically grooved cylinder
      mounted on a correspondingly threaded rod supported by plain and threaded
      bearings. While the cylinder was rotated and slowly progressed along its
      axis, the airborne sound vibrated a diaphragm connected to a stylus that
      indented the foil into the cylinder's groove.<br />
      <br />
      Although Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877, the fame bestowed on
      him for this invention was not due to its efficiency. Recording with his
      tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore
      easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction
      of sound was distorted, and good for only a few playbacks; nevertheless
      Edison had discovered the idea of sound recording<br />
      <br />

      Gramophones are continued to be manufactured and sold in the 2010s,
      although in small numbers. While some people still like the sound of vinyl
      records over that of digital music sources (mainly compact discs), they
      represent a minority of listeners. As of 2015, the sale of vinyl LPs has
      increased 49â€“50% percent from the previous year, although small in
      comparison to the sale of other formats which although more units were
      sold (Digital Sales, CDs) the more modern formats experienced a decline in
      sales.
